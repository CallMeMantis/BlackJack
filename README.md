# BlackJack
Im trying to create blackjack simulation (polish version "oczko")

14.03
- Game ends if you lose all money
- AI is disabled (AI always chooses to pick another card)
- You can pick cash rate, your amount of money
20.03
- AI chooses to play or not to play basing on your last move
- I've cleared some parts od the code (added Ai as class, starting_data as function and probably player as a class in the future)
21.03
- Player is now separate class
- oczko_previous_version is used as backup
21.03
- Naprawiony yes-no count bug
